                        Terms and Conditions of Sales. <br />
                        These terms are written by and for average people to
                        read and understand them. So, we encourage everyone to
                        read them. <br />
                        These terms apply to every person, business or
                        institution that purchases a product or service from
                        Your Number Guaranteed Inc. <br />
                        These terms may change periodically, and you agree to
                        accept these changes. <br />
                        All sales are final. <br />
                        If you are publishing any of our Technical Papers, you
                        can publish it once in any periodical, newsletter, email
                        mailing per US$0.99. You must note it’s origin from Your
                        Number Guaranteed, and Author, copyright date, and an
                        authorization number, which is your sales order number.{" "}
                        <br />
                        The Technical Papers are not to be altered from their
                        original version, or wording. Authors may submit to us
                        Technical Papers for publication on our website. It is
                        our exclusive right to publish or not publish these
                        articles on our website. There is no monetary
                        compensation paid to authors that we publish on our
                        website or our annual book or are published from our
                        partnerships with Technical Papers. If one of these
                        articles is published by others from our website, then
                        there will be no fee paid to the original author. The
                        idea is that Partners may develop applications for our
                        products and IP and submit to us a Technical Paper which
                        will help them sell their idea or product through
                        Technical Papers publications, and that is their
                        benefit, not the 99-cent payment for publication. All
                        Sales less than $50.00 US will be charged the Payment
                        Processing Fee that we are charged from our payment
                        processor. It’s about $0.79 All sales to Canadians, or
                        within Canada are subject to 13% HST. Sales to all other
                        counties are sales tax exempt in Canada. The purchaser
                        becomes the importer of record in their corresponding
                        country, and we will supply only the bill of sale as
                        actual documentation, which is created by your Stripe
                        Payment. This can be downloaded at time of sale. If any
                        person, business, group, institution or government body
                        uses our Name, logos, IP, trademarks, in any activities,
                        then they are doing so as a Partner. Anyone can register
                        and become a partner. If you are a Partner, then US$0.99
                        per person/product/application use per month applies. If
                        you are a partner and self-reporting, then you agree
                        that we may audit your activities and accountings at our
                        discretion. We reserve the right to bar the use of our
                        IP in instances where our values are not in line with
                        our Partners. If you have any questions, please send us
                        an email to ask how it works in your situation. We are
                        glad to work with you because we want things to be
                        affordable and fair. The purchase of a SUN, or Set of
                        Unique Numbers, allows the owner, or member to have
                        access to a suite of free applications. These
                        applications are limited to use by owner only. The owner
                        of the SUN agrees not to share/sell/rent or publish the
                        free applications with/to anyone else. We reserve the
                        right to limit the number of times a member can download
                        the same applications. In simple terms we want members
                        to be able to have applications on their phone, and or
                        computer and or tablet. If you get a new phone or
                        computer, then you should be able to download
                        applications on it. Essentially, we are trying to limit
                        copyright violations. We will take legal actions against
                        purposeful copyright violations, to recover our costs,
                        lost profits, and seek penalties for people or
                        organizations that intentionally violate our Copyrights.
                        If you purchase a SUN for anyone other than yourself,
                        that SUN belongs exclusively to them. On the purchase
                        page there is a form for a purchaser and owner. If a
                        Purchaser buys a Sun for an Owner (which is a different
                        person), then the Owner is the exclusive owner. The
                        owner of the SUN is responsible to keep it safe and not
                        share it with anyone else. Only share Snippets of your
                        SUN with trusted Partners. If you lose your SUN, then it
                        is not recoverable. You have read and agreed to our
                        $1,000,000 Guarantee. Your Number Guaranteed Inc. is
                        limited in liability to the purchase price of any
                        product or service. Any disputes are to be litigated in
                        the province of Ontario, Canada.

                        SUN is 100% Guaranteed that their SUN is unique. There

                        is a process to the challenge and it's not free, but if
                        you win the challenge, then you get the challenge fee

                        These are highly flexible tools which can be modified by
                        the user, in their circumstances, to provide varying
                        levels of security to their particular application.

i have data in an s3 bucket and I want to serve that data on my website which is deployed on AWS. 
The structured data is stored in parquet format.
The issue is that S3 objects , only allows pre-signed url for 1 pbject at a time and below is how my data is stored. 
So main folder F 0000 -> this is the folder that i want the consumer to download off of my website. 
Inside this folder i have 1000 subfolders laelled from Z001 to Z1000. Inside each of the Z folders is the parquet file.

I want the consumer to be able to download F0000 directly.
How can I get that done?

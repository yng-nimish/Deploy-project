Overview
A common scenario is where a Google Cloud Data Sharing Partner has proprietary datasets that customers can use for their analytics use cases. Customers need to subscribe to this data, query it within their own platform, then augment it with their own datasets and use their visualization tools for their customer facing dashboards. This enables Data Sharing Partners to simplify and accelerate how they build and deliver value from data-driven solutions.

Through integration with Google Cloud IAM, you can set permissions on BigQuery objects to enable access by users inside or outside of organizations. In this lab, you will learn how both Data Sharing Partners and their customers can use BigQuery data stored in a partner project in the form of customer facing dashboards for analytics as a managed service. You will be given three projects: the Data Sharing Partner project which owns the dataset and two separate and distinct customers who can access a subset of the dataset from their respective projects. Customers will list customer information specific to their geographical region.

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to:

Copy a public dataset into a Data Sharing Partner Project.
Create distinct authorized views for each customer.
Consume the authorized views to create customer-specific dashboards.
Setup and Requirements
Before you click the Start Lab button
Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Note: Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
Time to complete the labâ€”remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
Note: Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.
How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console
Click the Start Lab button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:

The Open Google Cloud console button
Time remaining
The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
Click Open Google Cloud console (or right-click and select Open Link in Incognito Window if you are running the Chrome browser).

The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.

Tip: Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

Note: If you see the Choose an account dialog, click Use Another Account.
If necessary, copy the Username below and paste it into the Sign in dialog.

Copied!
You can also find the Username in the Lab Details pane.

Click Next.

Copy the Password below and paste it into the Welcome dialog.

Copied!
You can also find the Password in the Lab Details pane.

Click Next.

Important: You must use the credentials the lab provides you. Do not use your Google Cloud account credentials.
Note: Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
Click through the subsequent pages:

Accept the terms and conditions.
Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
Do not sign up for free trials.
After a few moments, the Google Cloud console opens in this tab.

Note: To access Google Cloud products and services, click the Navigation menu or type the service or product name in the Search field. Navigation menu icon and Search field
Create authorized views
In the first project, you will take on the role of a Data Sharing Partner creating and sharing a dataset using an authorized view.

Create Authorized View A
From the lab pane. open the Data Sharing Partner Project Console and log in with the associated credentials.

From the Navigation Menu, go to BigQuery > Studio. If prompted click Done.

Click on + (SQL query) where you can run your query.

Run the following query to create an authorized view for Customer A, based on a public geographical dataset.

SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.zip_codes`
WHERE state_code="TX"
LIMIT 4000
Copied!
Click Run.

From the toolbar, click Save > Save view.

Keep the project as default and for the Dataset select demo_dataset.

For Table type authorized_view_a.

Click Save.

Create Authorized View B
In the query editor, remove the previous query you just ran.

Run the following query to create an authorized view for Customer B, based on a public geographical dataset.

SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.zip_codes`
WHERE state_code="CA"
LIMIT 4000
Copied!
Click Run.

From the toolbar, click Save View > Save view as.

Keep the project as default and for the Dataset select demo_dataset.

For Table type authorized_view_b.

Click Save.

Your authorized views should resemble the following:

In this section, you will assign permissions for each customer user and their associated authorized views.

Assign IAM permissions for Customer A
Under your project, inside of demo_dataset, open the authorized_view_a view.

Click Share.

Click on Add principal and add the Customer A user:
